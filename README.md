**1.) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
Well, this depends. If you're creating a program for a client you need open communication with the client to get a clear idea of the requirements. If you're just creating your own software for an end user, you would want to think about their experience while using the program. What do they want out of the program? What gets in the way of a good experience for them? What edge cases could arise in which the program or user experience fails? These are things you have to ask yourself even if you're working for a client. Creating user stories can help describe the actions that an actual user would take or want to take during the course of using the program.

**2.) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
My approach to developing programs has been largely incremental and modular. I like to also keep an organized file structure. Agile also encourages incremental development in most cases, so I hope to practice that skill more and more as I go.

**3.) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member in Software Development means you take responsibility for your own skills and work. You accept constructive criticism and guidance without taking it personally. You don't want to refuse an opportunity to learn or do things differently because that's what's required to make a team better. You want to always listen to the feedback your team provides as well as staying communicative about your own needs or ideas.
